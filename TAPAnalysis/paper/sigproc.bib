abstract     = {<p>Although connected devices and smart homes are now marketed to average
                consumers, little is known about how access-control systems for these devices
                fare in the real world. In this paper, we conduct three case studies that
                evaluate the extent to which commercial smart devices provide affordances related
                to access control. In particular, we examine an Internet-connected lighting
                system, bathroom scale, and door lock. We find that each device has its own
                siloed access-control system and that each approach fails to provide seemingly
                essential affordances. Furthermore, no system fully supports user understanding
                of access control for the home. We discuss future directions for usable access
                control in the home.</p>},
